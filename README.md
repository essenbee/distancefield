# distancefield
F# program by Mårten Rånge to calculate a distance field around a monochrome image. We used this program on Ep. 80 of Codebase Alpha live coding stream, to create a distance field texture for an image of the text "Codebase Alpha". This was then used in a truly electrifying "D shader, which we built live.
